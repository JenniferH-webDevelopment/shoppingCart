# shoppingCart

Congratulations on the next step in your application!


Hello Candidate,


We are excited to let you know you have progressed to the next stage in our recruitment process. This next step entails a short at-home coding exercise.


We recommend completing the exercise in the language you are most comfortable with.


Instructions:

Create a simple shopping cart as a web app. You may use JavaScript libraries but they are not a requirement, HTML/CSS and Vanilla JS are sufficient.

This app should satisfy the following minimum requirements:

Have a pre-populated (hard coded) array of objects as products.
Your product display should have (not limited to) product image, product name, product price
All products should be displayed when the page loads
Using an ‘add to cart’ button, the user should be able to add the products to a shopping cart list
The shopping cart lists all products and displays a the total price

Stretch Goals

The user should also be able to delete the products from the cart, thus modifying the total price of the cart
The user should be able to enter a quantity for each product

A sample screenshot of the project is given below. However, you’re free to create a layout and design of your choice



Requirements:

The code should be readable, reusable, and easy to modify. We're looking for production quality code.
A detailed Readme file which includes the following:
Setup instructions - Write out all of the steps to run your app locally
Discussion of technologies used - Make a list of the technologies you used including frameworks and libraries.
A section describing the requirements and how you met them.
Submission

Upload your completed project (including Readme file) to GitHub and submit your GitHub repo link. If you create a web app, please publish your app to GitHub Pages.

Next Steps

Once we receive your submission, we will review your code and let you know if you have progressed. If you are successful, the next stage will be an interview with one of our staff developers and you will be asked to discuss your solution, explain your design choices, and anything you included (or left out) from your solution. A high quality solution is appreciated, but they don't mind a simpler solution as long as you can clearly explain how you would improve it or adapt it to different requirements.

If you are not successful at this time, we encourage you to apply again in the future.  Thank you and good luck!
